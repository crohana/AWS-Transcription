##There may be a cost associated with transcription.  I am not responsbile for any cost you may incure using this program.  Refer to Amazon's documentaion to determine any potential costs you may incur.##

This is my first program.

I have included a sample audio file you can use to test.

To use this you will need to follow Amazons instructions for setting your computer up to use the Amazon API.

This program will upload an audio file to an Amazon s3 bucket then pass the information to Amazons transcription service.  Once transcription is complete the output of the file will have a link to download the JSON data of the transcription.
